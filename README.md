# Scientific Research â€“ Maximal Clique Enumeration in Sparse Graphs

This GitHub repository is dedicated to reading, analysis, and scientific research carried out as part of my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Mons (UMONS), Belgium.

My research topic, within the framework of my Master's studies, lies at the intersection of computer science and mathematics, with a particular focus on graph theory. This project aims to apply my skills in research and in-depth understanding of scientific literature to address the following problem: the enumeration of maximal cliques in sparse graphs in near-optimal time.

As part of this work, I conduct a thorough study of fundamental graph concepts, including cliques, subgraphs, and the notion of degeneracy. I also rely on a critical analysis of existing scientific works related to maximal clique enumeration, especially in sparse graphs. This research helps deepen my understanding of the most efficient algorithms and methods, as well as the specific constraints of this type of graph.

This project represents a key milestone in my scientific training, combining theoretical rigor and practical analysis in a constantly evolving field.
